The aim of this to test is to try and create a 160x600 version of the existing banner. You will need to follow the storyboard.jpg you have been provided within the src/developer-interview-text-2017-300x250/images/ to see how the finished 160x600 banner should look.

You should not overwrite the existing banner but make a copy that you can amend to make the correct size.

Good Luck!![storyboard-160x600.jpg](https://bitbucket.org/repo/x8Xo98z/images/970992812-storyboard-160x600.jpg)

## Working with bannertime
### Quick Start:

### Install Yeoman, Yarn, Gulp and Bannertime

`$ cd my-campaign`

### Run Bannertime
`$ yo bannertime`

### Run gulp
`$ gulp`

### Copy existing banner
`$ yo bannertime:copy`

## Notes:
It is important to check out [www.greensock.com/gsap](https://greensock.com/gsap) to get an understanding of how the GSAP animation library works. 

* scale: - Allows you to change the size of object.
* x: Horizontal plane
* y: Vertical plane

Its Duncan Bannertime!

## Usage

Use `gulp` to automatically launch the banner into the browser with browsersync all your changes will be reflected in the browser with each file save.

Use `gulp prod` to generate a ZIP file of all the assets of the banner, these will all have been minified as well.

Use `gulp backup-gen` to automatically generate backup images for each banner.

### Creating Elements

You can create DOM elements using the the `smartObject` function, this will initialise a `<div>` with the default style of: `position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;`.

You are able to set a background image, or set a nested image as a `<img>` element.

There are helper functions such as `center`, `centerHorizontal` and `centerVertical` to help you position the element.

Other settings are set using a helper function on the element which uses GSAP to process. So `this.logo.set({autoAlpha: 0, scale: 0.4});` is the same as `TweenLite.set(this.logo, {autoAlpha: 0, scale: 0.4});`

### Animating

The banner animation is run by the `animate` function.

By default we are using TweenLite with TimelineLite, but you can change which flavour of GSAP as you require.
